# Microcontrollers 
## Description 

Our boats all require a central "brain" to make computations and read sensors. Microcontrollers are essentially
tiny computers that we use to make computations for us from reading sensors, to transmitting data, and steering 
the boat. Each microcontroller has a bunch of I/O (Input/Output) ports that we can plug into in order to 
allow the boat to interface with a multitude of sensors. 

Please use this section of the documentation as a way of learning about different microcontrollers 
and logging our experience with each microcontroller.
