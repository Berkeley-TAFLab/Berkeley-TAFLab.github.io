# Sensors 
## Description

While designing our boats we tend to use many different kinds of sensors. These 
documents will serve as documentation of the sensors used in the lab and how to use them.

Please use this section of the documentation to document how different sensors are used.
Make sure to link relevant data sheets and starter code for people to use. Also include
any troubleshooting issues or any hardware issues so people know if certain sensors
are good or not.
