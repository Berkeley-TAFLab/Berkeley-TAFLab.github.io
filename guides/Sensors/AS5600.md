# AS5600 Magnetic Encoder

## Description

The AS5600 is the magnetic encoder we use in the wind vane and stepper motor. This document serves as a basic documentation of the provided Arduino library and some tips and tricks you can use while writing code for the encoder.

## Wiring Diagram

Assuming you’re using the device in I2C mode you should only need to connect the 5V pin on your microcontroller to the “VCC”, and the ground pin to the “GND” PIN. Then, connect “SCL” to “A5” on the UNO (WIRE_SCL on the ESP32) and “SDA” to “A4” on the UNO (WIRE_SDA on the ESP32)

## Recommended Libraries 

If you’re using anything related to the Arduino core I’d recommend using the provided AS5600 library and the standard Arduino Wire library. 

- [AS5600](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/as5600/) - Responsible for all functions to actually access the sensor. This library is compatible with the ESP32 using the Arduino core
- [Wire](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/communication/wire/) - Typically we use the AS5600 in I2C mode and this library is used in order to enable I2C connections. This library is compatible with the ESP32 using the Arduino core
